# Object-Oriented Programming and Design - LO21
This repository contains our assignments of the **LO21 - Object-Oriented Programming and Design** course. The course entails object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and some of the most significant notions such as **Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Generic Programming, UML, and Design Patterns**, focused on **C++ and Qt**.

## Course Project

As part of the course, we learned in groups of four to develop the game 'Hive' in both **console mode** and **graphical mode** using **C++ and Qt**. The project was to implement OOP principles in a real-life development setting. 

## Technologies Used

- **C++** for object-oriented programming
- **Qt** for creating a graphical user interface (GUI)
- **UML** for designing software
